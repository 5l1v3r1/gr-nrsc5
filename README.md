========

The goal of this project is to implement an HD Radio receiver and transmitter
in GNU Radio. HD Radio is standardized in NRSC-5. The latest version of the
standard is NRSC-5-D, which can be found at
http://www.nrscstandards.org/NRSC-5-D.asp.

So far only a transmitter has been implemented. A stand-alone receiver for RTL-SDR is available here: https://github.com/theori-io/nrsc5/

## Blocks:

### HDC encoder

This block encodes audio into High-Definition Coding (HDC) frames. The input sample rate must be 44,100 samples per second. ADTS headers are added to the output frames to facilitate synchronization. The encoding is performed by a patched version of fdk-aac: https://github.com/argilo/fdk-aac/tree/hdc-encoder

### PSD encoder

This block encodes Program Service Data PDUs, as described in http://www.nrscstandards.org/sg/nrsc-5-d-reference-docs/1028s.pdf. PSD conveys information (e.g. track title & artist) about the audio that is currently playing.

### PIDS encoder

This block encodes Station Information Service PDUs, as described in http://www.nrscstandards.org/sg/nrsc-5-d-reference-docs/1020s.pdf, and assembles them into the PIDS logical channel. SIS provides information about the station. Currently only the short station name (i.e. call sign) is encoded.

### Layer 2 encoder

This block assembles HDC audio frames and PSD PDUs into the audio transport, producing layer 2 PDUs (as defined in http://www.nrscstandards.org/sg/nrsc-5-d-reference-docs/1014s.pdf and http://www.nrscstandards.org/sg/nrsc-5-d-reference-docs/1017s.pdf).

### Layer 1 FM encoder

This block implements Layer 1 FM (as defined in http://www.nrscstandards.org/sg/nrsc-5-d-reference-docs/1011s.pdf). It takes PIDS and Layer 2 PDUs as input, and produces OFDM symbols as output. Only the Hybrid and Extended Hybrid modes have been implemented so far. The All Digital modes are not yet supported.

The output bytes map to symbols as follows:

| byte | constellation value |
|:----:|---------------------|
| 0    | -1-j                |
| 1    | -1+j                |
| 2    | 1-j                 |
| 3    | 1+j                 |
| 4    | 0 (unused channel)  |

## Flowgraphs:

Several sample flowgraphs are available in the apps folder:

* hd_tx_usrp.grc, hd_tx_usrp.py: tested on a USRP B200
* hd_tx_hackrf.grc, hd_tx_hackrf.py: tested on a HackRF One
* hd_tx_rtl_file.grc, hd_tx_rtl_file.py: produces an output file in the format used by https://github.com/theori-io/nrsc5/

These flowgraphs read a WAV file named sample.wav, which must be encoded at 44,100 samples per second. The license for the supplied sample.wav file is as follows:
